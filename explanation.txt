LICENSE: MIT
We went with the MIT license. We chose this license because
it is highly permissive, and has a very limited restriction on reuse.
That is totally fine for our project as we encourage changes and 
improvement from people who want to do so. MIT also seems to be a 
pretty common license, so it will be easily understood. 

CODE-OF-CONDUCT:
We went with the Contributor Covenant. We chose this Code of Conduct because it 
is one the most used Code of Conducts on the planet. Such open source giants 
as Firefox, Google, Microsoft, and Linux, not to mention the 40000 other open 
source projects. Becuase it is so common, it's rules will be easy for other
programmers to understand.l
