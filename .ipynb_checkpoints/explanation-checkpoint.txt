LICENSE: MIT
We went with the MIT license. We chose this license because
it is highly permissive, and has a very limited restriction on reuse.
That is totally fine for our project as we encourage changes and 
improvement from people who want to do so. MIT also seems to be a 
pretty common license, so it will be easily understood.
