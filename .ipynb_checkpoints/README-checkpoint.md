Our program asks the user for their name, and then asks the 
minimum and maximum value of die #1. The process is repeated
for die 2. The dice are rolled and prints the value of the dice
and which one was higher. 


# dd20

This program simulates D&D dice rolling, or any other
games with complex dice systems. It is highly extensible
for custom needs and behavior. 

## Installation 

**Python 3+ required for installation**

Use package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install dd20

```bash
pip install dd20
```

## Usage 

```python
import dd20

diceRoll = dd20.roll(1dd20+15)
str(diceRoll) # returns string for dice roll
diceRoll.total # returns total of roll
```
